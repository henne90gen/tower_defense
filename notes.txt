Path finding:

1. find any path from start to finish
    - take note of any junctions (other paths that need to be calculated)
    - abort if there is no such path

2. calculate all other paths
    - bring path to finish
    - bring path back to known finishing path


dict:
    key: tile index (int, int)
    value:
        object: direction_options, path_until_this_point
